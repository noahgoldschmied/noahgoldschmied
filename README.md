# Hi, I'm Noah
I'm happy you're looking at my profile. Take a scroll through it to learn more about me.

## About me
<ul>
  <li>I am currently working as an intern at RBC, pushing features to Tia, our AI Tech Support Bot</li>
  <li>I am a student at McMaster University, studying Software Engineering and Management</li>
  <li>My previous internship was also with RBC, as a developer in the Amplify Program (more on that below!) </li>
  <li>I have a passion for making impacts that go beyond just myself and my team</li>
  <li>I love learning, and am always eager to challenge myself to go further</li>
</ul>

## My Accomplishments
<ul>
  <li> <b>Technical Distinction - RBC Amplify:</b> At the culmination of RBC Amplify - AmpExpo - my team was selected as one of the 7 to present to C-suite executives and a room of 500+ people! At the end of the night, we were recognized with the top engineering prize of <b>$20,000</b> for engineering quality and craftsmanship throughout the internship. Winning this prize was super satisfying and made the 4 months of hard work even more special to me. </li>
  <li> <b>Provisional Patent:</b> Alongside winning the technical distinction award, Blink, the product that my team and I built, has been filed for a provisional patent. This is a super cool accomplishment that I am very proud of, and I hope to get a call in 3-5 years telling me that I am officially a patented engineer! </li>
  <li> <b>Dean's Honour List:</b> As a student at McMaster University, I have been placed on the Dean's Honour list <b> every year</b>, in recognition of my academic excellence. While grades are not my focus at school, I can attribute this achievement to my hardworking nature. I view school as a challenge for learning in a structured manner, and I believe my grades are a measure of my success in meeting that challenge. </li>
</ul>

## My Skills
#### What I Know
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white) 
<br> Java was the first coding language I learned, all the way back in grade 9. From then, I have used it in many products, ranging from simple OOP projects to the product I built during Amplify. I am super comfortable writing code in Java.

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
<br> After Java, I learned Python. It has been my main language for most of my classes, and I built my 'Name That Sport' project with Python and some libraries.

[![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=database&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](#)
<br> I first learned SQL in my database class, which I found super fun. During my Amplify project, I was in charge of building and maintaining our database.

## My Hobbies & Interests
#### Sports
I have been a massive sports fan for as long as I can remember. As a Toronto native, I am especially partial to the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Toronto Blue Jays. I am also a huge Steelers fan and have made my way to Pittsburgh a couple of times to watch them play in person. I have been in several fantasy leagues, and most of my coding projects revolve around sports. If you ever ask me what I am doing on a weeknight, there is a good chance my answer will be something along the lines of 'sitting on my couch and watching some hockey'.

#### Playing Sports
Beyond just watching sports, I also love to play them! While at McMaster, I played a bunch of intramurals, ranging from Softball to Floor Hockey, and even some wacky ones like Innertube Waterpolo. Now that I am back in Toronto, I still try to stay active by going to the gym 4 times a week. 

#### Video Games
Staying on theme here, the main video game that I play is the NHL game. I play the game with some of my buddies, and it is a great way for me to stay in touch with friends and blow off some steam after a stressful week.

#### Music
My favourite way to commute to work is to click on my Spotify Daylist. It ranges from country artists like Evan Honer and Tyler Childers, to rap music, with J Cole and Kendrick. I have also recently started going to more concerts, and I really love the smaller venue ones. Something about an artist and 500 other people singing the same song is really touching to me.
