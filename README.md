# Hi, I'm Noah!
I'm happy you're looking at my profile! Take a scroll through it to learn some more about me and some of my accomplishments!

## About me
<ul>
  <li>I am currently working as an intern at RBC, pushing features to Tia, our AI Tech Support Bot</li>
  <li>I am a student at McMaster University, studying Software Engineering and Management</li>
  <li>My previous internship was also with RBC, as a developer in the Amplify Program (more on that below!) </li>
  <li>I have a passion for making impacts that go beyond just myself and my team</li>
  <li>I love learning, and am always eager to challenge myself to go further</li>
</ul>

## My Accomplishments
<ul>
  <li> <b>Technical Distinction - RBC Amplify:</b> At the culmination of RBC Amplify - AmpExpo - my team was selected as one of the 7 to present to C-suite executives and a room of 500+ people! At the end of the night, we were recognized with the top engineering prize of <b>$20,000</b> for engineering quality and craftsmanship throughout the internship. Winning this prize was super satisfying and made the 4 months of hard work even more special to me. </li>
  <li> <b>Provisional Patent:</b> Alongside winning the technical distinction award, Blink, the product that my team and I built, has been filed for a provisional patent. This is a super cool accomplishment that I am very proud of, and I hope to get a call in 3-5 years telling me that I am officially a patented engineer! </li>
  <li> <b>Dean's Honour List:</b> As a student at McMaster University, I have been placed on the Dean's Honour list <b> every year</b>, in recognition of my academic excellence. While grades are not my focus at school, I can attribute this achievement to my hardworking nature. I view school as a challenge for learning in a structured manner, and I believe my grades are a measure of my success in meeting that challenge. </li>
</ul>
